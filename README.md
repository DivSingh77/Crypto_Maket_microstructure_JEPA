🪙 Crypto Trading Pipeline
A high-frequency cryptocurrency trading pipeline that collects real-time market data using WebSockets, performs feature engineering, and predicts price movements using an Self-Supervised, Energy-Based(EBM) machine learning model with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture(JEPA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC). This project includes a web interface and a FastAPI backend for serving predictions and interacting with the system.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-trading-pipeline.git
cd crypto-trading-pipeline
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
4. Open the frontend
Open index.html in your browser to interact with the system.

🧠 Model Overview
The model is built using PyTorch and implements a Long Short-Term Memory (JEPA) architecture to predict short-term price movements based on historical market features like:

Price changes
Order book deltas
Trade volumes
🛠️ API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/	Returns HTML interface
POST	/predict	Returns price movement prediction
📦 Requirements
See requirements.txt for the full list of dependencies, including:

websocket-client
python-binance
torch
pandas, numpy
fastapi, uvicorn
📌 Notes
Ensure you have access to Binance API if using secured endpoints.
The model is currently trained on simulated or historic data and may require fine-tuning for live trading.
For actual trading integration, risk management modules should be added.
